The Ant build file in this directory can create the JAXB generated classes
via the 'jaxb' target.  The 'clean' target will remove the generated
com/learningjava directory as well as compiled classes, so do not modify the
generated classes in that location.


Q: Why is this folder so messy?

A: The Ant build for this folder builds classes to this directory to keep
things simple for readers who are building and running the examples on the
command line.
